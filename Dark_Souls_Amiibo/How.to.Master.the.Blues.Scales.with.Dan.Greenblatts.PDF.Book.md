The blues scales are derived from adding an out-of-key "blue note" to an existing scale, usually the minor pentatonic scale[^3^]. The blue note is typically the flattened fifth degree of the scale, which creates a tension that can be resolved by moving to another note. The blues scales are widely used in jazz, blues, rock, and other genres of music, as they can convey a range of emotions and moods.
