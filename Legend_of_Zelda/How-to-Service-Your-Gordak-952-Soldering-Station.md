However, like any other soldering station, the Gordak 952 requires regular maintenance and service to keep it in optimal condition. Here are some tips on how to service your Gordak 952 soldering station:
 
- **Clean the soldering tip**: The soldering tip is the most important part of the station, as it transfers heat to the solder joints. To prevent oxidation and corrosion, you should clean the tip after every use with a damp sponge or a brass wool. You should also tin the tip with fresh solder to protect it from oxidation.
- **Replace the nozzle**: The nozzle of the hot air gun determines the size and shape of the hot air stream. You should choose a nozzle that matches the size of the component you are working on. To install or replace the nozzle, you should wait until the heating tube and the nozzle are cool, then loosen the screw of the nozzle and insert or remove it gently. Do not use excessive force or pliers to avoid damaging the nozzle.
- **Check the pump**: The pump of the hot air gun provides the air flow for the hot air soldering. You should check the pump regularly for any signs of wear or damage. If you notice any abnormal noise, vibration, or low air pressure, you may need to replace the pump or contact a professional service provider.
- **Calibrate the temperature**: The temperature of the hot air gun and the soldering tip are controlled by a microcomputer sensor that adjusts according to your settings. However, over time, the sensor may lose accuracy due to external factors such as voltage fluctuations or environmental changes. To calibrate the temperature, you can use a thermometer or a thermocouple to measure the actual temperature of the hot air gun or the soldering tip, then compare it with the displayed temperature on the LED screen. If there is a significant difference, you can adjust the temperature setting button until they match.

By following these simple steps, you can ensure that your Gordak 952 soldering station performs well and lasts longer. Remember to always use caution when handling hot or electrical parts, and wear protective gear such as gloves and goggles.
