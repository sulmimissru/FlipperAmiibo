## Why use Google Voice over magicJack?
 
Google Voice is a free service that offers many features and benefits that magicJack does not. For example, Google Voice lets you:

- Choose a phone number from any area code in the US or Canada.
- Make and receive calls from any device, such as your computer, smartphone, tablet or smart speaker.
- Forward your calls to multiple numbers at the same time or in sequence.
- Transcribe your voice mails and send them to your email or text message.
- Record your calls and store them online.
- Set up custom greetings and call screening options for different callers.
- Integrate with other Google services, such as Gmail, Hangouts, Calendar and Contacts.

On the other hand, magicJack is a paid service that requires you to buy a device and renew your subscription every year. It also has some limitations and drawbacks, such as:

- You can only use one phone number per device and you cannot change it easily.
- You can only make and receive calls from the device that is plugged into your computer or router.
- You cannot forward your calls to other numbers or devices.
- You cannot transcribe your voice mails or send them to your email or text message.
- You cannot record your calls or store them online.
